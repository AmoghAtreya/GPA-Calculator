# GPA-Calculator
This program enables high schoolers to calculate their 'weighted' and 'unweighted' Grade Point Averages (GPA). 
The program also utilizes the CMU Graphics Library developed by Carnegie Mellon University. The library allows the programmer to create an aesthetic and usable interface on a canvas with shapes. 

NOTE: If you want to run this program on your computer, please install the CMU graphics library! Here is the link: https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop
